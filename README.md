# Recommendation-Systems

## Data Description:
Amazon Reviews data ( data source ) The repository has several datasets. For this case study, we are using the Electronics dataset.

## Objective:
Build a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on the their previous ratings for other products.

## Steps and tasks:
1. Read and explore the given dataset. (Rename column/add headers, plot histograms, find datacharacteristics)

2. Take a subset of the dataset to make it less sparse/ denser.( For example, keep the users only who has given 50 or more number of ratings ) 

3. Split the data randomly into train and test dataset. ( For example, split it in 70/30 ratio) 

4. Build Popularity Recommender model. 

5. Build Collaborative Filtering model. 

6. Evaluate both the models. ( Once the model is trained on the training data, it can be used to compute the error(RMSE) on predictions made on the test data.)

7. Get top - K ( K = 5) recommendations. Since our goal is to recommend new products for each user based on his/her habits, we will recommend 5 new products. 

8. Summarise your insights.
